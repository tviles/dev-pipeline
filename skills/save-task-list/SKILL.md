            A skill just finished saving a task list for session reuse.
            Evaluate the assistant's final message below.

            $ARGUMENTS

            Verify:
            1. A task list ID was found and displayed
            2. A startup command (CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID=<id> claude) was provided
            3. A task summary was shown

            Return {"ok": true} if all three are present.
            Return {"ok": false, "reason": "Missing: <what>"} if anything is missing.

# Save Task List for Reuse

Save the current session's task list so it can be restored in future sessions.

## Session Context

- **Session ID**: ${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}
- **Active task directories**: !`ls -1t ~/.claude/tasks/ 2>/dev/null | head -5 || echo "none found"`
- **Current tasks in session**: !`ls -1t ~/.claude/tasks/ 2>/dev/null | head -1 | xargs -I{} ls ~/.claude/tasks/{} 2>/dev/null | head -10 || echo "no tasks"`

---

## Instructions

1. **Find the current task list ID** by checking `~/.claude/tasks/` for the most
   recently modified directory. List the directories sorted by modification time.

2. **Verify the match** — read the task files inside the directory and compare
   them to any tasks you know about from this session. Confirm you have the
   correct task list.

3. **Log the session mapping** — write the mapping to `.claude/dev-pipeline/sessions/`:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p .claude/dev-pipeline/sessions
   echo '{"session": "${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}", "task_list": "<TASK_LIST_ID>", "saved_at": "'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'"}' \
     >> .claude/dev-pipeline/sessions/task-lists.jsonl
   ```

4. **Output the startup command** for the user:

   ```
   To continue with this task list in a new session:

   CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID=<task_list_id> claude
   ```

   Explain: On startup, the SessionStart hook will verify the task list exists
   and show a confirmation message.

5. **Show the current task summary** so the user knows what's preserved
   (task subjects, statuses, and any dependencies).
